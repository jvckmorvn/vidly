## Introduction

This is a lightweight movies list app built to practice fundamental React concepts like state, props, and the dreaded "this". Movies can be added, filtered, liked, updated, and deleted. All information on the page is rendered dynamicaly according to the component(s) it pertains to. Note that changes are not persisted between sessions as this was intended to be a purely front-end exercise. As such, the "Login" and "Sign up" pages are merely decorative.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
