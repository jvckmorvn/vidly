## Introduction

This is a mock-up film rental app built to practice fundamental React concepts like state, props, and the dreaded "this". Movies can be added, filtered, liked, updated, and deleted. All information on the page is rendered dynamically according to the component(s) it pertains to. Note that changes are not persisted between sessions as this was intended to be a purely front-end exercise. As such, the "Login" and "Sign up" pages are merely decorative.
